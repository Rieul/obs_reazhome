## Highlights
- Bubble is a wildly improbable artifact - a graphic novel adaptation of a comedy/drama podcast that manages to turn podcasting into a visual medium.

- Written by @Jordan_Morris and @sarahlmorgan with art by @TangoCharlie and colors by @Snarlbear, this @01FirstSecond book manages to recapture the comedy, the snark, the trenchant commentary and the drama of the original @MaxFunHQ podcast series.

- Bubble is a comedy/sf story about a distant outpost on a hostile planet where human colonists live under armored domes that keep out the hostile, overpowered critters that live on the surface.

- The bubble-dwellers have lives much like our own, dominated by social media, nostalgic sitcom binge-streaming and precarious gig work whose miseries are relieved by craft beer and trivia nights.

- The corporation that owns the bubbles and ultimately controls the lives of the colonists is mostly benign, except when it is arbitrary and vengeful, and it certainly is innovative.

- For example, when monsters start to make incursions into the bubble, management harnesses the power of market forces to fight them, launching Huntr, a gig-work app that connects freelance monster-hunters with residents who have monsters that need hunting.

- Unlike a boring state-based public safety apparatus, these freelance Huntrs are incentivized to keep it all really entertaining, stalking the interlopers with cool parkour moves, shouting dope catchphrases, and then posing for dead-monster selfies afterwards.

- But it turns out that gig work isn't actually that great, actually. And also, maybe living in a company town isn't all that great even if you can order a really good oak milk latte with an app with great UX .

- Maybe, in fact, it's all kind of...sinister? Plus, a lot of the best Huntrs are also bush-babies - born and raised outside dome among people who live with monsters in the wilds - and there's something a little weird about the way the company is recruiting and scoring them.

- The conspiracy that unspools - about mutant powers, a mystic crystal, and a deep secret about the founding of the colony - makes a great vehicle for a cast of fantastic, snarky, flawed characters and hilarious, dry and ironic dialog.

- It feels like a perfect synthesis of the weaponized irony and meta-humor of the best of 90s culture and Millennial tired-of-this-bullshit rage. The acting in the original audio drama caught this perfectly (especially @tavitulle's performance).

- The transition to visual storytelling replacing that acting with superb character design and delicious facial expressions from Cliff's art. In either medium, this is a knockout.
