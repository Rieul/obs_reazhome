Cryptocurrency basics
===
> by [Dave Troy](https://twitter.com/davetroy)

## Highlights
- 1/There are people who are genuinely trying to talk intelligently about cryptocurrencies, but can’t because they don’t have historical background. This thread tries to correct that by suggesting required reading. First, it’s necessary to know what problem it attempts to solve.

- 2/Bitcoin is designed to be “sound money.” It can’t be controlled by government. What’s mine is mine, what’s yours is yours, and can’t be “diluted” by shadowy “central bankers,” lurking in their urban apartments, smoking cigars — or worse, eating lox bagels.

- 3/This has been an obsession of a certain kind of person for over 100 years. Protocols of the Elders of Zion (1903) was an early propaganda piece out of Russia, later amplified by Henry Ford.

- 4/The creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 and the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 terrified the industrial aristocratic class; the mob was at the gate. They were coming for their money, one way or another.

- 5/The rich did not take this lying down. They began to organize. In 1933 they tried to overthrow the US government and capture or kill FDR, to restore the Gold Standard (sound money) and kill the Federal Reserve. They were not successful.

- 6/Meanwhile another idea had taken root: race science, funded for decades by industrialist backers. Also known as “Eugenics,” the theory was that humans could only evolve if “superior” genes were propagated, requiring “competition” and “free markets.”

- 7/In 1937, Wickliffe Draper started the Pioneer Fund, which for decades would support a range of “race science” inquiries and informed “research” developing in Nazi Germany. Remember the “Bell Curve?” That’s Pioneer Fund.

- 8/A weird cult group called “I AM” also got underway in the 1930’s. It was obsessed with gold (“sound money”) and chanted: “Blast blast blast the Roosevelts from this earth.” Robert LeFevre was convicted in 1940 for his role in the gold cult.

- 9/LeFevre would go on to found the “Freedom School,” which laid the foundation for and promoted American libertarianism and Austrian economics. One pupil and supporter of the Freedom School? Charles Koch (see Dark Money, by Jane Mayer)

- 10/By the late 50’s, the “sound money” goal wasn’t any closer. Candy magnate Robert Welch founded the John Birch Society to avenge “creeping communism” (the enemy of sound money) in the US. Eisenhower was too pinko for them.

- 11/A similar “anti-communist” movement had been brewing globally, and reunited wartime fascists with emerging networks in Asia (Taiwan, South Korea, etc). The World Anti-Communist League aligned with JBS and “sound money” policies.

- 12/American libertarianism as promoted by LeFevre was heavily influenced by “Austrian School” economics, which posited that individual gain and competition determined all economic activity, and deduced a framework from that. (Narrator: it’s nonsense.)

- 13/Still obsessed with gold, competition, and Eugenics, a new generation had entered the fray. Allying with Reagan in 1981, the Council for National Policy set out to operationalize the John Birch Society/WACL agenda. (Narrator: they did #Jan6.)

- 14/By 1988, “I AM” was long gone, but a successor, Church Universal and Triumphant, continued the pursuit. Elizabeth Clare Prophet here cites prominent libertarians Ron Paul, Murray Rothbard, and Anthony Sutton, saying gold is America’s destiny.

- 15/In 1997, two noted libertarians James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg, publish “The Sovereign Individual,” a screed about the demise of nation states, “digital cash” (gold), and disdain for taxes. Peter Thiel later wrote a foreword.

- 16/Robert Mercer, a computer scientist and linguist trained under John Bircher Revilo Oliver, believes the Eugenics trope that earnings equates to societal value. He later funds Cambridge Analytica and attempts to engineer elections.

- 17/Peter Thiel goes on to manipulate American politics and also gets involved in more race science, directly connected to Pioneer Fund characters. He also backs the creation of Ethereum.

- 18/Members of the Council for National Policy tried to do on Jan 6 2021 what their forebears could not do in 1933 with the Business Plot: forcefully overthrow the US government. This is a detailed breakdown of their involvement.

- 19/Today, cryptocurrencies are attempting to drive “sound money” by pushing FOMO around Bitcoin, which is propped up by a fraudulent project called Tether. The hope is that “network effects” (Thiel’s specialty) will kick in and drive widespread adoption.

- 20/Bitcoin and NFTs have been packaged as helping “the little guy” get ahead. This is called “class collaboration” and weaponizes working people on behalf of the ultra-rich. Mussolini did this too, under the name “class collaboration.”
  https://t.co/DEJA5KrgM9 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/davetroy/status/1478017759741153283))
- 21/And in fact, most Bitcoin is controlled by just a few people; it’s not “democratized” in any way. Just 0.01% hold 27%. It’s just one more shot at the old “sound money” fever dream, floated on the backs of average people as accomplices.

- 22/No discussion of crypto would be complete without mentioning its staggering waste of energy; or the real goal of displacing the dollar as the reserve currency, so as to maximize oil/gas industry returns over time. Learn about that in my audio series.

- 23/Anyone blindly promoting cryptocurrencies without understanding the full background of “sound money,” gold, race science, and white supremacy is unwittingly advancing an agenda they don’t comprehend. Pretending it isn’t there won’t make it go away. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/davetroy/status/1478017763750862853))
- 24/The background provided here is just skimming the surface. There is plenty more. It’s called “history,” and it’s not had near enough attention. So we are repeating past episodes, but this time with tech bells and whistles. Please read up, get informed, and educate others. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/davetroy/status/1478017764954681344))
- 25/This is part of an effort to destabilize the world so the “gold” network can gain primacy and “evolve” the human race. I didn’t sign up for this agenda, nor did most people. Awareness can stop it, but it needs to be crushed with prejudice. Just like Smedley Butler did in 1934. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/davetroy/status/1478017765927788555))
