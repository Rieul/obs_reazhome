## Highlights
- I just finished my master in Interaction Design at Malmö University, and thought I could present very quickly here the research I have conducted for my thesis project titled "Design for Obsolete Devices". You can find more info here: https://t.co/zVZwuk3Txo
  [1/11] 
- My main theoretical point in this thesis argues for reconsidering the term "obsolescence". I argue that obsolescence is highly dependant on the socio-cultural context, and that the well-working of products depends on a wide network of other actors.

- A second point is a focus on the typologies of publics that suffer the consequences of obsoletion processes. These differences of excluded profiles reproduce existing discrimatory traits that can be observed in the society (age, race, gender, wealth...).

- Designing for recent devices only means forgetting to include categories of the population who are already marginalized. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnaelleBeignon/status/1406886215580782592))
- I took the case study of the digitalization of public services in Sweden and identified different scenarios that would make public services harder to be accessed for the citizens who do not own a smartphone. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnaelleBeignon/status/1406886216977588224))
- I focused on two services in particular: the electronic identification (Mobile BankID), and a public transportation mobile app (Skånetrafiken). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnaelleBeignon/status/1406886218688831490))
- During my design process, I conducted interviews with people who use or used dysfunctional devices. I also conducted a probe experiment in which I asked two participants to quit their smartphones for one week. One of them was provided a flip phone instead (on the picture).

- I also mapped the public transportation infrastructure according to the on-site information available for people who cannot access online information or online ticket purchase.

- I conducted a call experiment and tried to get in contact with various Swedish public services without owning a mobile BankID.

- I propose two ways of "bending" the existing public infrastructures to obsolete devices' users.

- This is a very very very condensed version of my work, if you are interested to learn more, you can watch the video of myself presenting the project or read the thesis on this webpage: https://t.co/zVZwuk3Txo ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AnaelleBeignon/status/1406886246421512194))
- I'm very surprised (but also very happy) about the success of these tweets. I will jump on this opportunity of visibility to put my resume here as I believe that anyone who shares interests in this topic would be a person I'd love to talk and/or work with.
