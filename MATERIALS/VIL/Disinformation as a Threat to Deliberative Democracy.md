## Highlights
- I’m delighted @PRQjournal has published my article with @mckayspencer, Disinformation as a Threat to Deliberative Democracy. It shows how disinfo may degrade the quality of conversation needed for democracy to work, & not just by spreading falsehoods https://t.co/eyfMdLbIk4 (1/n) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cjtenove/status/1281677684582432768))
- Sure, disinfo actors are liars who lie. But studies of disinfo campaigns show they also aim to corrode moral respect, foster distrust for institutions that produce high-quality information, and crowd out voices that ought to be present in public discussions (2/n) https://t.co/AcQWaX8ZiM ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cjtenove/status/1281677694531284992))
- We introduce some fancy terms for harms that disinfo may promote “epistemic cynicism,” “techno-affective polarization” and “pervasive inauthenticity.” If you’ve seen a Twitter debate go from “I disagree” to “liberals are idiots” to “shut up bot”, you get the gist (3/n) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cjtenove/status/1281677695965782017))
- Our article draws extensively on research on Russian disinfo campaigns, and we owe a huge debt to folks like @noUpside @pnhoward @farkasjohan @toledobastos @Golovchenko_Yev @GregoryEady @codybuntain @j_a_tucker @JosephineLukito @camillefrancois (4/n) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cjtenove/status/1281677697249247232))
- We also build on insights from a really dynamic community of investigators of online media manipulation: @BostonJoan @_pmkr @wphillips49 @cward1e @YBenkler @GordPennycook @decustecu @samuelwoolley @alicetiara @beccalew @HeidiTworek (5/n) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cjtenove/status/1281677698666950656))
- One key point is that disinfo actors, polarizing politicians and social media companies shouldn’t take all the blame. As @katestarbird, Arif and Wilson put it, disinfo is "participatory in nature". Citizens need to take some responsibility. https://t.co/rUNXBdCQhV (6/n) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cjtenove/status/1281677700013281280))
- At the core of this article is the concept of “deliberative systems.” Here we rely on the great work of people like Simone Chambers, Mark Warren, Jane Mansbridge @jgastil @ba_lyons @selenAercan @profparkinson @AlfMoore @TobyRollo @CarolynHendriks (7/n) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cjtenove/status/1281677702064291840))
- Our article looks at responses to democracies' vulnerability to online disinfo. It's bad but not hopeless! A few standout suggestions are @ekvraga @LeticiaBode @tullyme https://t.co/iJVyd6boyv (8/n) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cjtenove/status/1281677703318433793))
- A digital media literacy intervention to increase discernment between mainstream and false news in the US & India @BrendanNyhan @andyguess @ba_lyons @michaelhlerner @Jacob_Montg @JasonReifler @NeelanjanSircar https://t.co/3ZzcmNFCdp (9/n) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cjtenove/status/1281677704509526016))
- A really helpful report on government and platform policy options, including the important idea of introductions "friction" to misinfo, from @gmfus @KarenKornbluh @ellgood https://t.co/TnP4ue3asy (10/n) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cjtenove/status/1281677705797230593))
- I mapped out the government policies around the world designed to respond to the threat disinfo poses to the democratic values of self-determination, accountable representation and public deliberation

- Finally, thanks again to @PRQjournal @LayWilliams and our reviewers. And especially to @mckayspencer. This article has been a long journey, with several painful setbacks and occasional bouts of “what the hell are we trying to say?” But we carried it to the end.
