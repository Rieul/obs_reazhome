  (9/...) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/valmasdel/status/1433782083810381824))
- The adaptive capacity of most ecosystems and social-ecological systems will be exceeded by unabated anthropogenic climate change, and significant adaptive capacity will be required to cope with residual climate change even under ambitious emissions reduction.
  (10/...) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/valmasdel/status/1433782085689528338))
- In a world increasingly affected by climate change, maintaining biodiversity relies on enhanced and well-targeted conservation efforts, coordinated with and supported by strong adaptation and innovation efforts.

- Biodiversity conservation approaches such as Protected Areas have been essential for successes to date, but, on aggregate, have been insufficient to stem the loss of biodiversity at a global scale.
  (12/...) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/valmasdel/status/1433782358948384775))
- A new conservation paradigm would address the simultaneous objectives of a habitable climate, self-sustaining biodiversity, and a good quality of life for all.
  (13/...) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/valmasdel/status/1433782488518774786))
- The area of intact and effectively protected land and ocean required to meet the three objectives of a habitable climate, self-sustaining biodiversity, and a good quality of life is as yet not well established.

- Several land- and ocean-based actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore ecosystems have co-benefits for climate mitigation, climate adaptation and biodiversity objectives.
  (15/...) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/valmasdel/status/1433782637727043602))
- Actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems that address societal challenges such as climate mitigation and adaptation are often referred to as nature-based solutions. 
  (16/...) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/valmasdel/status/1433782713715249183))
- Nature-based solutions (NbS) can play an important role in climate mitigation, but the extent is debated, and they can only be effective with ambitious reductions in all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. 
  (17/...) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/valmasdel/status/1433782777443504128))
- Nature-based solutions can be most effective when planned for longevity and not narrowly focussed on rapid carbon sequestration.
  (18/...) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/valmasdel/status/1433782841725304834))
- Implementing nature-based solutions also creates co-benefits for adaptation to climate change, for nature and its contributions to people.

- Active management in conservation, such as through altering wildfire frequency or reintroducing key species can be beneficial for both biodiversity and climate mitigation and adaptation but can be antagonistic in some contexts
  (37/...) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/valmasdel/status/1433787157387284480))
- Achieving synergistic benefits and trade-offs between biodiversity conservation, ecosystem service enhancement and climate change mitigation is strongly dependent on which biomes, ecosystem uses, and sectoral interactions are under consideration.

- Locally motivated biodiversity conservation actions can be incentivized, guided & prioritized by global objectives and targets, such as climate benefits. Every local initiative matters, since the benefits of many small, local biodiversity measures accumulate at the global level. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/valmasdel/status/1433787456965447686))
- Changes in per capita consumption, shift in diets, and progress towards sustainable exploitation of natural resources, including reduced post-harvest waste, could make substantial contributions to addressing the biodiversity crisis, climate change mitigation and adaptation.

- Assessing the range of viable solutions (‚Äòsolution space‚Äô) to achieve the intended climate mitigation, adaptation and biodiversity conservation outcomes, while positively contributing to people‚Äôs quality of life, requires recognition of differences in social-ecological contexts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/valmasdel/status/1433788788900352024))
- In the presence of strong and apparently unavoidable trade-offs within the biodiversity-climate-society nexus, promoting social tipping interventions to modify the ways society and nature interact can be a viable joint solution.
