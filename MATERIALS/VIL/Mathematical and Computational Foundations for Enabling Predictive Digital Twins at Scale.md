- "A digital twin is not a generic computer model, but a unique model of a specific airplane or medical patient, updated...it will evolve and follow the physical twin through its lifecycle."

- "A lot of people point to the Apollo program as the first time digital twins were used. @NASA was able to take data from the damaged spacecraft during Apollo13 [1970], feed it into their simulation, and use it to bring [the astronauts] home."

- "I don't believe a digital twin has to be an exquisite replica in order to be useful. It has to be fit for purpose."

- "If you listen to popular press on digital twins, it's all about getting massive data flows & then applying machine learning...but we need physics models to give us the robustness that we seek. The physics is essential."

- "What is so powerful about physics-based models is that they open a predictive window into the future...but they are computationally expensive. Simulating just one rocket engine takes months of computer time."

- How to reduce the order of a high-dimensional physics-based model and to abstract physical assets and their digital twins into math:
  "The digital state cannot represent [everything], nor does it need to."

- "When it comes to measuring a physical state, we can almost never experience it directly. We always have sparse, noisy data."
  Karen Willcox (SFI/@OdenInstitute) on using dynamic Bayesian networks for predictions about the future states of unique assets:

- "All of these different tasks sit on top of a probabilistic graphical model and 'light up' different factors...it is a unifying framework to integrate across the data, models, and decisions."

- "Uncertainty is represented in everything, at every step of the way. This is absolutely critical. You have to bring uncertainty along."
  Karen Willcox (SFI/@OdenInstitute) provides a specific case study for the application of DigitalTwins:
