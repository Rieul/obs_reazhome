## Highlights
- Net zero is the new climate denial: a COP26 thread. 1/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doreenstabinsky/status/1458843894473494530))
- Net zero denies history and responsibility. Net zero is forward looking – towards 2050 and beyond. It erases the history of how we got here. 2/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doreenstabinsky/status/1458843896243531782))
- It erases responsibility for the situation we find ourselves in. 2400 Gt CO2 of the 1.5 budget is already used up, mostly by the wealthy countries of the world. 3/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doreenstabinsky/status/1458843898458030086))
- Net zero only focuses on how to spend the remaining carbon budget to keep warming below 1.5 °C, implying that we all should be sharing it equally. Inequity is baked into a net zero frame for climate effort. 4/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doreenstabinsky/status/1458843900211306496))
- ‘Net’ zero obscures the need to phase out fossil fuels (zero) by focusing on “net”, passing the buck to ‘nature’ or imagined future technological removals. 5/

- So net zero not only helps wealthy countries claim more than their fair share of the remaining carbon budget (they actually used that up years ago but that’s another story). 6/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doreenstabinsky/status/1458843904862834694))
- ‘Net zero’ pledges are used as tools to appropriate nature as a resource for the wealthy to soak up emissions. 7/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doreenstabinsky/status/1458843907270365190))
- Bankers and financiers are constructing the great house of cards of a voluntary carbon market to grab, buy, and sell that nature. 8/

- But there isn’t enough nature to soak up another 60 million years’ worth of combusted fossilized nature. The house of cards will burn, with all of us in it. 9/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doreenstabinsky/status/1458843911401746433))
- Net-zero-fueled climate denial means emissions-as-usual continue, accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere continues, warming continues. There is no away. It’s a recipe for a 3 °C world. 10/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/doreenstabinsky/status/1458843913427562499))
- Get rid of this idea of ‘net.’ It’s genocidal and ecocidal. Emissions have to go to zero, or as close to zero as possible. Phase out fossil fuels now. 11/
