## Highlights
- 1/ It's also the case that @jeffbezos forgot to thank the people bidding up the price of Amazon's stock. Everyone seems to ignore that his wealth comes from Amazon stock sales, not from his personal share of Amazon's profits.

- 2/ Bezos doesn't personally get to keep Amazon's profits, and if he did, he'd be worth only about $6 billion, not the $200+ billion he has today. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/1417921280376979457))
- 3/ I've done the math, multiplying Amazon's profit each year since IPO by his percentage ownership, which has declined from 41% at IPO to 11% today as he has sold or otherwise disposed of shares. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/1417921281316560896))
- 4/ Amazon's stock price is only loosely correlated with its profits. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/1417921282247639045))
- 5/ It comes from an entirely different economy, which I call the Supermoney economy, in which people with too much capital to get the returns they want in the operating economy try to get outsized returns in the betting economy.

- 6/ I explained this idea recently using a different billionaire as the case study in https://t.co/4O8dLaQin9 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/1417921284982386693))
- 7/ Bezos also forgot to thank the Federal Reserve and other central banks for Quantitative Easing, which has flooded the world with capital, helping keep stock prices so high! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/1417921286102204422))
- 8/ In many ways QE is a 2nd mortgage on our collective future, so you could make the case that Bezos and other stock market billionaires are borrowing their wealth from all of us. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/1417921287213752320))
- 9/ We're all placing a collective bet that worldchanging innovations that the betting economy might encourage will make us richer faster than the lost bets impoverish us. It might be a good bet, or it might not. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/1417921288220327936))
- 10/ But at least we should be clear that's the bet we're making, and stop pretending that Bezos is Scrooge McDuck. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/1417921289122160643))
