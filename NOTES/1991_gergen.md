The saturated self: dilemmas of identity in contemporary life

## Abstract
Today's ever-expanding communication technologies force us to relate to far more people and institutions than ever before, in a multiplicity of forms—on the telephone, in person, across time and space. And each of these demands a different conception of ourselves. More than at any other time in history, each of us is not one self but many. So intense is our social saturation, argues Kenneth Gergen, that we take on the personas and values of the people with whom we communicate. The result is an erosion of our sense of objective truth, a multifaceted assault on our notions of the "true and knowable," the unified moral core. In this powerful and provocative work—early drafts of which have provoked intense discussion here and abroad—Gergen explores these profound changes in self-concept and their implications for cultural and intellectual life. His wide-ranging survey—ranging from anthropology to psychoanalysis, from film and fiction to literary theory—probes the prospects and perils for a world in which the self is never what it seems and truth lies in the stance of the beholder and the relationships of the moment. The book vividly describes the mobile, urban, affluent "knowledge class," which, according to Gergen, is at the vanguard of the new era. Because this book confronts headlong many of the central issues in contemporary intellectual debate—deconstructionism, poststructuralism, and relativism—it is sure to attract wide attention.
