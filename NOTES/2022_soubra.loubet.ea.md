Situated energy transition : Facing the local past. The Prats-de-Mollo case study
===

## Abstract
How are energy transition dynamics intertwined with situated energy pasts ? The communication I am giving you today aims to inform this issue with a case study. This is the case of an ongoing research- action program that is taking place in a village which is engaged in a process of transforming its energy infrastructures. Whether as stakeholders or observers of this process and of the research-action program, we noticed the importance of the local pasts on the ongoing dynamics in Prats-de-Mollo. I am going to detail to you the hows of this observation and the different ways energy pasts broke into the experimentation and affected it.
